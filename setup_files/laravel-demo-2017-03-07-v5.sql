Everyone says, &ldquo;You have to work with my Realtor. They&rsquo;re the best.&rdquo; But they can&rsquo;t all be the best... Can they? Not only can a bad realtor cost you thousands of dollars, they can also cost you your dream home by mucking up the offer, or some other part of the process. Here are a few reasons why it&rsquo;s dangerous to work with the wrong Realtor. <img alt="Find A Realtor Toronto" src="/uploads/real_estate_new/new-7.jpg" style="height:500px; width:600px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Because it&rsquo;s Actually TOO Easy to Find a Realtor in Toronto</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is so easy to open Google, click a few ads and think you&rsquo;ve found a world-class Realtor. The problem is that a Realtor can easily look the part, without delivering the goods. It&rsquo;s never been cheaper or easier for anyone to get a professional and amazing looking website, or great looking postcards. But great marketing from a Realtor does not necessarily equal great service. They may have more style than substance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Because They Need to Close the Deal. Nothing Else Matters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding houses for you is only part of the job. Your Realtor could do the <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/realestate-search/">best real estate search in Canada</a>, but it doesn&rsquo;t help you unless they can actually close these homes for you. Of course, it takes skill to be able to showcase a home professionally and get the buyer excited about the property. But in the hyper-competitive Toronto real estate market, there is almost always going to be a bidding war. The price you see in the MLS listing is only the start. Your Realtor needs to put together a simple and compelling offer, with the price and conditions that your buyer will want. The offer and the process are where a truly great real estate agent will shine. Because There&rsquo;s So Much at Stake in the Toronto Real Estate Market Overpaying for a home in most markets may mean you paid a few extra thousand dollars. But in Toronto, that number can easily swell into the tens of thousands of dollars in a hurry. You&rsquo;ve scanned <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/history-mls-listings-toronto/">MLS listings</a>, you can see what&rsquo;s at stake. You need to ensure your Realtor is dialed into the <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/toronto-real-estate-market-booms-despite-warnings/">Toronto market</a>. That means they&rsquo;re not just aware of the current trends, they can predict where the market is heading.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Because You May Not Know They Were Bad Until Years Later</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a nightmare scenario that&rsquo;s a little too real for most buyers. You find a real estate agent. They suggest you skip the home inspection because the seller has other aggressive offers on the table. This could bring your offer to the top. They said they&rsquo;ve inspected the house themselves and it looks amazing. Fast forward a few years. You learn that the house actually has massive structural issues, and you&rsquo;re now on the hook for them financially. It happens all the time. The Realtor doesn&rsquo;t have your best interest in mind. They simply wanted to close the deal to make the commission and move on. Meanwhile, you thought they were hustling so you didn&rsquo;t lose out on your dream home. So when you&rsquo;re trying to <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/find-best-realtor-toronto-2016/">find a Realtor in Toronto</a>, make sure you do your homework. Look beyond their website or postcard and ask for references. Be sure to ask the references about the entire process they went through, especially the offer and the close!</p>\r\n', '<p>Everyone says, &ldquo;You have to work with my Realtor.

The pricing trends in the housing market have constantly been on a rise with no end in sight of these prices falling in the near future. This Toronto Real Estate price trend is quite perturbing as it could be the target for taxing foreign investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Statistics</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The statistics which prove that there are ample causes of worry with regards to the Toronto real estate market are: &bull; There were more than 10,000 homes, <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/ontario-real-estate-search/">which were resold in the Greater Toronto Area in July 2016</a>. &bull; The number of homes that changed hands in July 2016 was higher than any recorded number for July in any of the previous years. The sales in October 2016 were 11.5% higher than those of October 2015. &bull; The resale price average of homes increased by 16.6%. &bull; The price of detached homes increased by 21%. In fact, there has been a constant sales increase by 10% year on year for these detached home sales. &bull; The Home Price Index MLS Composite Benchmark increased by 19.7% year on year. &bull; There were new listings in October 2016 which showed a marginal increase over the previous year&rsquo;s October, however, this was not enough to balance the sales growth and the seller&#39;s market prevailed. &bull; The semi-detached, as well as townhouses, also saw annualized price gains which were in double digit numbers. &bull; The price of Condos increased greater than 9% as compared to the previous year during the same month. &bull; The new listings decreased by 7% in the last month. &bull; Implications of the increase in prices of Houses for sale Toronto <img alt="Toronto Real Estate" src="http://realestate.homula.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Graph2-2.jpg" style="height:300px; width:600px" /> There are various implications with regards the increase in prices of resale homes. &bull; The first is that the Ontario government has imposed a 15% tax on residential properties which are purchased in the Vancouver area by the nonpermanent residents. This could affect the Toronto housing demands &amp; foreign buyers will choose to rather invest in the Greater Toronto Area instead of choosing the Vancouver area. &bull; <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/lawyers-firms/">According to Ontario government and legislations</a>, in order to decrease foreign speculation, a tax was implemented and this increased the prices of real- estate by 30% in the metro area of GTA. &bull; Due to the tax imposed, fierce bidding wars and increased price gains, there is more trouble on the horizon. The trend makes it hard for those who want to <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/realestate-agent/">Find a real estate agent Toronto</a> &nbsp;in order to purchase their homes. The reason is due to the decreasing supply of homes which are on the resale market. &bull; There is also a lot of unease when people are conducting a <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/ontario-real-estate-search">Real estate search</a>. &nbsp;In fact, even the Bank of Canada has warned that the growth is unsustainable. Housing policy is being looked at in different levels of the government. The Federal government too has started a working group in order to come up with the various recommendations in order to ensure that the housing in Toronto &amp; Vancouver is more affordable. &bull; Another reason why there is unease is that the sellers who are going to sell to those who are overseas or going to sell to investors have more angst as they are not sure if there will be a tax imposed on foreign buyers or on buyers who are not permanent residents of the area. &bull; In fact, there is a lot of uncertainty as the Mayor John Tory, as well as the Finance Minister, wants to see how the tax imposed Ontario,Toronto, GTA area has an effect. &bull; It is believed however that this trend is set to slow down in the near future and in fact, during the second half of the year it will cool down considerably due to the general belief that the rates of the mortgage will remain low as a result of the Brexit. &bull; The advice which perhaps is the most pertinent in the given circumstances with regard to the <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/ontario-real-estate-search/">MIS listing search</a>, &nbsp;is in case there is no pressing need to buy real estate, you should not do so and rather prefer to sit tight and not move, as there is a holding pattern which is currently found among homeowners. This advice is especially pertinent as there are policy makers at different levels who are brainstorming on different solutions as regard the lacking of low rise inventory which is all over the Greater Toronto Area. <img alt="mls listings toronto" src="http://realestate.homula.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/graph-2.jpg" style="height:300px; width:600px" /> &bull; Reasons for the high Toronto&rsquo;s Real estate market The reasons why Toronto&rsquo;s real estate market is so high are: &bull; The foreign and domestic investors are pushing up the local prices. In fact, in the Toronto area, the domestic investors contribute to 25% &amp; foreign investors contribute between 5% to 10% of the total home purchases. &bull; There are extra buyers in the market who are competing due to the amount of data which is available to them to help them in understanding the market. Due to the interest in investors, there are several people who are entering the buyers market &bull; There are people who even are ordinary homeowners who are buying houses just so as to capitalize on the market as they see the prices are increasing by 10%-20% &bull; The investor in the Toronto Real Estate market does not need to make a conditional offer on selling the home and normally bypasses inspections as he or she is only doing it for the sake of the profit. &bull; The investor&rsquo;s mortgage interest payments &amp; the renovation costs are tax deductible. These are deducted from the income they earn when they rent the house and therefore, they are more interested in to find a real estate agent Toronto, to help them in purchasing houses, especially with the price increase which they are seeing which give them a good return on their investments. &bull; Investors in the <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/">Toronto Real Estate</a> can bid higher than those who are purchasing the house to live in. The reason is that the buyers who want to live in the home usually do not go very high as they have to set aside money for the renovations.</p>\r\n', '<p>Recently, the Toronto Real Estate has witnessed some very disturbing drifts in terms of price fluctuations.</p>\r\n', 5, 1, '', '', '2016-11-30 17:00:00', '2017-03-06 14:37:21'),
(4, 'TORONTO REAL ESTATE UTILITIES', 'toronto-real-estate-utilities', '/uploads/real_estate_new/new-6.jpg', '', '<p><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/utility-companies/">Utilities</a> are services provided by the public that is paid for in form of a utility bill that is mailed to the owner or tenant. Utilities include water, electricity, sewerage and phone utilities. Some of these are taken care of by the authorities like the municipal councils. The bill for utilities is billed according to the usage of the amenities. When a tenant moves in to a residential property, an agreement is drawn and signed between the landlord and tenant to agree on who gets the utility bill for the utilities. This agreement is crucial so that there is no blame and lack of provision for these very important utilities. Each utility carries its charge, and no utility is charged like another since they are all different things. Depending on how much utility is used, billings are issued every month or in some cases, they are issued three times a year. There are many payment options that can be used to settle a utility bill in Toronto including the pre-authorized utility bill payment program. Other payment options include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Internet banking</li>\r\n	<li>Mobile payments</li>\r\n	<li>Mail</li>\r\n	<li>Drop boxes for payments</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pre authorized utility bill payment program</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>This program applies to residents of Toronto who must first enroll to the city of Toronto&rsquo;s pre-authorized utility payment program that allows financial institutions that the owner has provided in PUP to withdraw utility payments every payment date. After the withdrawal and settlement of the utility bill, an electronic receipt is sent to the owner as proof of payment and the amount paid for what bill. This program cannot be transferred or used for another property beside the one it is registered for. This means that when a tenant moves out of t a house, the utilities are gone, and they need to cancel their pre-authorized utility bill payment program. The earlier signed agreement between the landlord and that tenant ceases to be binding until another tenant moves in and another agreement is signed. When one purchases a new property in Toronto after selling the previous property, the utility payments do not transfer to the new home, every property gets its own utility bills and utilities.

Most electric bills range between $ 30 and $ 50 per month. There are ways that one can reduce this charge by cutting down on their power usage when they do not need it and using more energy efficient bulbs in houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water bill</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Water is essential for survival and is therefore very important. Paying the water utility bill ensures that water supply is not cut off or reduced. A water meter is mostly installed to take water usage readings and calculate the expected bill. The average payment per month for water is $80.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waste and sewerage bill</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The removal and disposal of dirt from residential areas and into the appropriate dumping sites is a utility that attracts a monthly charge of up to $322.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp; iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phone utility bill</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the digital era has erupted, phone bills are not as popular as cell phones that are much more preferred for their portability, advancement, and ease of use. However, all homes with a home phone have to pay a monthly phone utility bill. When a payment is late, a fine is applied to the late fees and may also be accompanied by a discontinuation of the pre-authorized utility bill payment program. When a utility is discontinued for lack of pay, after completing the payment, an extra fee is charged for the reconnection of <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/utility-companies/">the utility</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p>When a tenant moves in to a residential property, an agreement is drawn and signed between the landlord and tenant</p>\r\n', 6, 1, '', '', '2016-11-30 17:00:00', '2017-03-06 14:37:36'),

The MLS listing trademark is a very important part of the system that ensures the exclusivity of the system and the rights that the MLS system holds on their name, services and building blocks. A trademark will identify the system and ensure that no other company can come up with the same name and exact services. This helps protect the system. The trademark is not just used as anyone pleases. Whether by members or non-members, the MLS trademark is to be respect and used in adherence to all the requirements that are stated for the use of this service and the trademark. The MLS trademark should be used as an adjective and not a noun as it is used to describe the standard of MLS services, not the listing system. The MLS trademark can be used in marketing merchandise like t-shirts and caps that are aimed at popularizing or spreading a particular message on behalf of the <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/mls-listing/">MLS listing</a> service. These are most popular in MLS listing events and any rallies held by or on behalf of the MLS. Registration of trademarks is not compulsory but is important in protecting ownership of the business. The kind of symbol that is used on a trademark has a different use. The MLS&reg; system means that the trademark has been successfully registered.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Requirements for the use of the MLS trademark</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Must be permitted to use the MLS trademark</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is covered under license and agreement which is an elaborate term of the MLS that states, only associations of realtors are freely allowed the use of the MLS trademark. Only with special permission that is written and signed can a non-member use the trademark. Members of associations of realtors are allowed use under the guidance of their respective association that ensures they uphold the requirements and rules attached to the use of the MLS trademark.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Must always be used in capital letters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The MLS trademark is in capital letters and must always be used in capital letters so that it is used correctly. If the trademark is used in small letters or one of the letters is in small letters, then that is not the MLS trademark and represents something entirely different. Anyone found in violation risks being stripped off their use of the trademark privileges.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Must always have the trademark sign</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The trademark sign may not ring as important to most people but without this sign, it is not clear that it is a trademark or just and abbreviation of the multiple listings service. The MLS&reg; is important to denote the standard of the service. The symbol is the most important part in identifying a trademark from any other denotations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The trademark should not be combined with anything else</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is required that no other words or symbols are combined with the trademark as it makes the trademark less commanding. This makes the standard that the trademark represents less effective and respectable. A trademark is sufficiently capable of representing itself and does not need to be introduced or overly decorated to be noticeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do not use the trademark in domain names</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The realtor associations and the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that is responsible for managing the MLS trademark strictly prohibits all members or anyone using the trademark from using it in their domain names.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The MLS trademark should not be used in meta tags</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>People will want to associated and identified with the MLS and end up using the MLS trademark in their page descriptions or titles. This is not allowed as only the MLS service has rights to the trademark and no individual or entity should try to identify themselves with the MLS listing system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Benefits of a trademark</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Defines a business</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The trademark is what defines a business and its products. The trademark is used on all products and service documentations to explicitly show that source and the business responsible for the products.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Exclusive ownership rights</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The trademark symbol may seem insignificant but it is a very powerful tool that gives exclusive ownership rights to the individual or entity that filed for the trademark. Once the trademark has been approved, there is no other person that can claim ownership. There is a system that is used to check for availability of the trademark selected. Once it is confirmed that no other companies have registered under that trademark it is issued. A trademark is unique to every business and no two companies can share a similar trademark even if in different parts of the world as this could cause confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Protects the owner and the business</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Competitors cannot use a similar mark as a trademark to try and dupe their way into stealing clients from the original holder of the trademark. If the holder of a trademark suspects this is the case that a competitor is using their trademark, they have the right to take legal action against the competitor where they will both be required to provide documents proving their ownership of the trademark. The trademark helps a business be able to sue for damages depending on the situation or on what the damage to the business name or trademark is. The protection that the business and the owner is given by registering a trademark is usually forever because trademarks have no expiration dates on them.</p>\r\n', '<p>A trademark is the identifying factor of any single thing, the industry of franchise.</p>\r\n', 4, 1, '', '', '2016-11-30 17:00:00', '2017-03-06 14:37:49'),

Yes, the city feels great in this New Year.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Reasons can be varied, but one thing is for sure; the real estate market of the city is all time high and getting larger with every passing year. Designated as the most populous city of Canada, house for sale Toronto is making all news these days. Predictions after predictions, real estate gurus have been eagerly waiting for the latest development in the market prices. Realtors, Buyers, and sellers all have geared up the in anticipation of better future in this New Year, especially in the Greater Toronto Area. House for sale or rent in Toronto is majorly driving real estate prices to double-digit at the start of 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A small pond with too many fishes.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lack of house on sale in Toronto is the major rider driving the soaring real estate prices in the city. The end of the year 2016 marked the lowest number of listings as indicated by Jason Mercer, TREB&rsquo;s director of Market analysis. This was the lowest in the past 16 years. <img alt="graph1-2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13378" src="http://realestate.homula.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graph1-2.jpg" /> Moving forward in this regards, assumptions of a shortage of listings is expected, hence a rise in prices again. The TREB further predicted the soar in average housing prices from the last year could be as high as $95,078 with impact mainly on the low-rise type housing. The double-digit rise in the property prices could fall anywhere in between 10-16 percent. The board has called for all sorts of firms to fuel the supply of property in Toronto.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Involvement of foreign flock of investors seems Jittery!!!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Folks, whether sooner or later, there is some buzz of the introduction of Foreign Buyers tax for the GTA region. Let&rsquo;s Flashback to Last August at Vancouver; introduction of Foreign Buyers tax. Well, the city did witness a fall in sale of houses to a rather concrete level, to be very precise 30-40 percent decline in monthly sales. So, it is imaginable that such buzz in GTA would send wrong signals to foreign buyers who constituted 4.9% of last year&rsquo;s sale, thereby affecting the real estate market in a not so favorable way. The Building Industry land Development Association&rsquo;s take is no different from that TREB says and it backs the latter&rsquo;s view owing to the lack of inventory.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Past is the foundation of the future</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us have a look at property prices report of TREB for December 2016 which will trace the road map for 2017 Average property price for a. Detached houses &gt;&gt;&gt; $ 1,286,605 b. Semi-Detached. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $808,920 c. Row/Town &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $927,471 d. Condo Town &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $569,864 e. Condo APT &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $466,592 <img alt="graph12" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13379" src="http://realestate.homula.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graph12.png" style="height:561px; width:966px" /> Any aspiring purchasers/investors in real estate can predict what&rsquo;s in store using the suggested rate of increase i.e. 10-16% The Toronto and GTA market is all red hot in this New Year. The TREB is concerned with the fewer options available. For keeping right track and analysis of the real estate market it hired the survey firm, Ipsos. The poll made it clear that foreign investors took a 5% share of the market and 2% of them were driven by a tax levied on Vancouver. The lack of space in the city has to be dealt, for this association and leaders from Ontario are laying down suggestions, the latest being by Mr. Hudak who called for a reassessment of the Greenbelt Expansion plan by the government on the outskirts of GTA. The proposed expansion did impose an unsaid restriction on the Builders who could help increase the housing inventory. Overall, amongst the hazy situation on laws and policies, rate shoot is guaranteed. The drive to buy or rent property in Toronto is high and sellers are definitely going to profit the way road map of the housing industry is being carved. Lest double-digit rates increase lead to the dreaded bubble burst. The lawmakers must be cautious with every step they take, just a thought!</p>\r\n', '<p>Reasons can be varied, but one thing is for sure; the real estate market of the city is all time high and getting larger with every passing year.</p>\r\n', 5, 1, '', '', '2017-02-07 03:13:41', '2017-03-06 14:38:03'),

Are they really driving prices up? They don&rsquo;t think so, and they don&rsquo;t want you to think so either. It&rsquo;s easy to feel that way, in such a competitive market. You work hard to <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/agents/" target="_blank">find a Realtor in Toronto</a>, you make your bid, and you lose out to the foreign investor. It can be frustrating. The whole process can really leave you feeling sour, and lead you to think that they&rsquo;re eating into the Toronto&rsquo;s supply of homes for sale, and perhaps even bringing up the prices. <img alt="Toronto Real Estate" src="http://realestate.homula.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/graph10.png" style="height:561px; width:966px" /> But let&rsquo;s take a closer look at foreign investors&rsquo; real impact on the Toronto real estate market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Foreign Investors and Toronto Real Estate: Fact vs. Fiction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a popular idea these days that foreign investors are swooping in and taking all the good properties.

The CBC also recently reported that: <img alt="find a Realtor in Toronto" src="http://realestate.homula.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/graph3.png" style="height:561px; width:966px" /> According, the recent survey of Toronto-area real estate agents, domestic investors now make up 25 percent of their client base Overall, in Toronto home prices jumped 21 percent from a year ago and now average $762,975.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Recent Rule Changes and Foreign Investors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign investors were recently dealt <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages-real-estate/federal-government-closing-tax-loophole-used-by-foreign-home-buyers">a rule change</a> that makes it harder for them to invest in Canada, from afar. In October, it was announced that foreign investors could no longer utilize a tax loophole that helped some to avoid paying capital gains taxes as their homes appreciated in value. Now, however, buyers who were not residents at the time a home was bought will no longer be able to claim a principal residence exemption. Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the changes without calling out foreign investors by name and said all of the new rules (which included implementing mortgage stress tests for all insured borrowers as well ) are in the name of making sure Canada&rsquo;s housing market remains stable and affordable for Canadian buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Not All Foreign Investors are Looking to &ldquo;Flip&rdquo; a House</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of foreign investors want to fight the belief that they&rsquo;re just sitting back from afar, and are going to just turn around and sell the property for a profit. Peter Walsh and his wife own three houses and two condos, and rent them to people they claim may not be able to get quality housing from most landlords or property owners. &quot;What I feel we&#39;ve done is perhaps help people,&quot; Walsh <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/toronto-real-estate-investment-market-prices-1.3834959">told the CBC</a>. &quot;I can justify it to myself in saying I don&#39;t think I&#39;m hosting anybody or demanding excessive rents.&quot; He even accepted a painting from one of his tenants who makes their living as an artist, as a way of helping with the rent. So if you&rsquo;re trying to find a Realtor in Toronto, be sure to ask them if they have a strategy when bidding against investors (be it foreign or domestic).

Small real estate brokers compete directly with the largest firms in an equal-opportunity environment. &bull; As long as buyers and sellers choose a real estate firm that has a membership in a MLS, they can have peace of mind in knowing their interests are not limited to a small pool of options. &bull; Sellers get the benefit of increased exposure of their property. Buyers get the benefit of working with one agent while having access to information about all MLS-listed properties. &bull; <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/agents">Real estate professionals</a> create, maintain, and pay for the private databases for MLSs. Access to the expanded range of listings shared by agents is a service that greatly benefits buyers and sellers, and it is often free of charge. &bull; All information in a MLS database is not accessible by the public. Neither the safety nor the privacy of sellers is compromised. For instance, information regarding the vacancy of a home for purposes of showing it is never advertised or made available to those who are conducting an MLS listing search. &bull; Sellers and buyers can readily and conveniently access information about available real estate listings on the website of their agent of choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How an MLS Listing Search Works</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Real estate brokers know how to put an MLS to work for their clients, whether buyers or sellers. The following are some of the steps involved with making a MLS work: &bull; For sellers, the important thing is to ensure that the agent places their property on the market within the MLS, so that other brokers have access to the information. &bull; The real estate professional searches the database for property that fits the needs and price range of the client. &bull; Special attention is paid to new MLS listings, placed on the market recently. This is why property gets more attention when first listed. Agents will typically preview the property before showing it to clients because t<a href="http://realestate.homula.com/about-us/">hey want to be sure it&rsquo;s a good fit for buyers</a>. &bull; In short, a home or property is listed in the local MLS; brokers preview the home; and the property is advertised, which gives visibility for the benefit of homebuyers and their agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When are MLS Listings Updated?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The frequency in which new real estate listings and other changes are updated in a MLS is dependent upon the service and the area in particular. The following provides a glimpse of how often various MLSs update their listings: &bull; Larger MLSs update data almost instantly, and the updates are published to the Real Estate Transaction Standards (RETS) feed within a few minutes. &bull; With some MLSs, updates are only published on weekdays but not weekends. &bull; Many MLSs opt to update MLS listings a certain number of times per day, such as once hourly. &bull; Virtually every MLS updates at least once daily, with the exception of those that don&rsquo;t update on weekends.</p>\r\n', '<p>An MLS listing is real estate featured with a Multiple Listing Service (MLS).

(3, 'Is finding a space without hiring a broker a good idea?', '<p>Generally, the answer is no. It is just like going to the IRS without having a CPA by your side. Now let us examine a couple of cases where you might lease space on your own. The biggest driver is the dollar value of the lease commitment. The less space you lease and the shorter the term, the less rent that is due under the lease. Less rent means a smaller commission. A listing agent is much more motivated to lease space directly to a tenant versus having to share their commission. This is especially true for small spaces that generate small commissions. Also, if you are leasing a small space, you sometimes can&rsquo;t get a tenant representative to work for you because it is simply not worth their time.</p>\r\n'),
(4, 'What is a representation letter?', '<p>A representation letter is something a tenant representative or broker will ask you to sign. It has several purposes. First, it demonstrates your commitment. Once the tenant representative or broker has that letter from you, they know that they are much more likely to get a commission on your lease. This means that they will work hard for you. In fact, a good tenant representative or broker will not do much more than a simple market survey without a signed letter. If you want to get the most out of the brokerage community, we recommend that you sign an exclusive agreement rather than working with several different agents on a non-exclusive basis.</p>\r\n'),
(5, 'Whom does a broker work for?', '<p>Brokers generally work in two capacities: as listing agents or as tenant representatives. Some, if not most, do both. Meaning that they have property listings and they also work as a tenant representative. If you are working directly with the property listing agent, be sure that the broker is working for the property owner. If you hire a tenant representative that also has listings, then you need to have a very good understanding of what listings they have and what conflicts they have. For example, in addition to the fiduciary issues that come with representing both parties in a transaction, the agent will most likely make more money if you lease a space at his listing. Instead of having to split the commission, he collects both sides.</p>\r\n'),
(6, 'How do Commercial Real Estate Professionals get paid?', '<p>Commercial Real estate agents are typically paid by a commission upon the signing of a lease. The commission is paid by the owner of the building and is typically paid one-half upon lease execution and one-half upon tenant occupancy. The commission is most often calculated as a percentage of the lease value and usually ranges between four to six percent. For example, if a tenant signs a 3-year lease for 2,000 square feet at $20 per square feet per year, a 5% commission will total to $6,000. To further complicate matters, the agent&rsquo;s Broker is the one that gets paid with the commission. The Broker then pays a portion of the commission to the agent, depending on the agent&rsquo;s split. Commission splits range anywhere from 50/50 (most common) to 90/10 in favor of the agent. Using the sample computation, the agent would receive from $3,000 to $5,400 net.</p>\r\n'),
(7, 'How does the Commercial Real Estate Industry work?', '<p>Most owners of real estate hire real estate agents to lease their property on their behalf. The agent obtains a listing agreement, which calls for that agent to act on the owner&rsquo;s behalf as a fiduciary in leasing the property. The agreements are performance based, meaning the agent earns a commission upon the signing of a lease. The commission is typically paid one-half upon lease execution and one-half upon tenant occupancy. Owners of real estate can lease their own properties without having to have a real estate license. Real estate agents are also required by law to have a salesperson&rsquo;s license issued by the state that the agent does business and must pass an exam in order to obtain a license.</p>\r\n'),
(8, 'Is it safe for condominium board not to have liability insurance?', '<p>This is a major decision for the Board of Directors. We would strongly suggest that the board consult with an insurance agent and broker about the type of coverage that is available. Further, you can discuss with your lawyers as to the legal implications of not having a proper insurance and the coverage that would be appropriate from a legal perspective. In short, you as a Member of the Board of Director could be sued in your capacity as a Director or Member of the Board of the condominium corporation for an omission or error and you need to understand that your personal legal exposure to such an action and to what extent insurance coverage alleviate any concerns you have in serving as a director or member of the board.</p>\r\n'),
(9, 'As a Unit owner, what should I ensure in particular?', '<p>Aside from the property unit that you owned, you should also insure any betterment to the unit that may include those installed by a previous owner and any personal belongings. It is also important to familiarize yourself with your declaration, by-laws and master policy and provide a copy to your insurance agent or broker to eliminate the possibility of any gaps in your individual coverage or duplication with the insurance the condominium corporation has. An example of betterment includes original carpeting that would cost around $2000 to replace, hardwood floor that costs about $5000. You can also insure the amount that exceeds to what the insurance covers with your condominium corporation. For example, the total betterment cost is $5,000 yet the corporation&rsquo;s insurance only covers $3,000, then you can have a separate add on insurance to the remaining amount, which is $2,000.</p>\r\n'),
(10, 'As the condominium unit owner, do I need insurance?', '<p>All condominium unit owners should consider having insurance especially on liability coverage. Although the Condominium Property Insurance Act only requires the condominium corporation to get insurance, you as a unit owner should also have an insurance coverage especially if you purchase the property through a mortgage financing and the condominium declaration, in one of its prohibition, require a mandatory insurance for all unit owners.</p>\r\n'),
(11, 'Is your new condominium unit insured from replacement cost?', '<p>A common misunderstanding issue at the time of turn-over for a new condominium is whether an insurance appraisal is required. It is usually assumed that a developer&rsquo;s construction cost is an accurate reflection of the replacement cost of the condominium and that an insurance appraisal is not necessary. Insuring a condominium for its construction cost often will results in an under-insured or over-insured condominium property. Appraisals on Insurance coverage should also be done on a regular basis. For example, an insurance appraisal can be done prior to each renewal of the insurance policy. The reason behind this is that if a major catastrophe occurs where the property is substantially damaged and the insurance coverage is inadequate, where do the funds come from to repair and/or replace the damage? The owners could be required to pay significant assessment to facilitate the repair or replace the damaged property.</p>\r\n'),
(12, 'What must a Condominium Corporation insurance cover?', '<p>The Condominium Corporation&rsquo;s insurance should cover the Corporation&rsquo;s liability to repair the units and common elements after damage which can be a result from fire, accidents and other risks identified in the declaration or by-laws. This particular obligation is specified in section 50(1) of the Condominium Property Act. With this, it is therefore critical for the condominium corporation to review these documents with an insurance broker in order to identify what specific needs should be covered under the master insurance policy. In general, the condominium corporation&rsquo;s obligation to repair the unit is to restore to its original state, bringing back to a state where it was originally constructed.</p>\r\n'),
(13, 'Who pays for the Condominium Corporation insurance and does it have to submit proof of insurance?', '<p>It is the unit owners themselves that pay for the condominium corporation&rsquo;s insurance. It is not a separate account but rather it is included as part of the monthly condominium fees which is specifically allocated from the operational fund. With this, it is the duty of the condominium corporation to present proof of insurance to the entire unit owners as well to the Director of Condominiums.</p>\r\n'),
(14, 'Does the Condominium Corporation need to prepare and submit a financial statement every year?', '<p>Yes, and a copy of the annual financial statement must be furnished to every unit owner either by mail or personal delivery. Aside from this, Condominium Corporations must also file a copy of the financial statement to the Director of Condominiums 10 days before the annual unit owner&rsquo;s meeting be conducted. It is also deemed necessary for the financial statement to be reviewed by an accountant before being presented to the unit owner&rsquo;s and submitted to the Director of Condominiums. More importantly, the financial statement should contain the details of its assets and liabilities as well as the income and expenses for the year.</p>\r\n'),
(15, 'What are the fees incurred with the approval of a new condominium project?', '<p>As prescribed under the Condominium Property Act, all developers for a new condominium project will have to pay for the approval fees depending on the size of the project. For a two &ndash; unit development the fee is $1,300 and a condominium complex with more than 50 proposed units can cost $20,500. There is also a prescribed fee for the approval of any revision, which states a one-time fee of $500 for a phase development and $400 per unit for a residential or commercial condominium complex. You should take note that the approval fee is different and separate from the Land Title Registration Fee.</p>\r\n'),
(16, 'What are the processes that needs to be undertaken for a New Condominium Complex to be approved?', '<p>First, the declarant through his agent or lawyer will advise the Director of Condominiums through a written notice which expresses his or her intentions to create a new condominium project indicating the number of proposed units and the approximate time to finish the project. Next, the Director of Condominiums will review the declaration including its survey plan, by-laws and for any revisions that are incorporated. The Director can also visit the site and check for himself the progress of the construction development. Finally, the developer must submit to the Director the approval fees and the Land Title Registration Fees coupled with the declaration and description of the condominium property.</p>\r\n'),
(17, 'What are the different classifications of a Condominium?', '<p>A commercial condominium has a building complex that is intended to be divided into smaller units for commercial use. It can have more than one single detached building that will serve the same purpose. In comparison, a residential condominium also has a building complex similar with a commercial condominium but is intended for residential purposes. Some condominium complex can adopt a mixed-used approach, meaning it can be both intended for commercial and residential purposes. A phased development for condominium property is a stage by stage construction of the condominium complex where the liability of the developer will be relieved once the project has complied and finished.</p>\r\n'),
(18, 'What is a Declaration and a Description?', '<p>As far as the Condominium Property Act is concerned, a declaration is a document that creates the Condominium Corporation. It details out their roles and responsibilities in the repair and maintenance of the common areas. It also provides an outline of the condominium&rsquo;s provision regarding occupancy and utilization. It further specifies the common expenses and each individual unit owner&rsquo;s proportionate interest in the common elements detailing individual owner&rsquo;s percentage contribution to the overall expenses on the complex&rsquo; common areas. On the other hand, a description is a combination of a survey plan, construction and structural plans and the details of the borders of each individual unit boundary.</p>\r\n'),
(19, 'How do condominium unit owners, developers and employees resolve disputes?', '<p>In case if a dispute arises between a developer, unit owner or employee of the corporation, a dialogue or meeting with the person or persons involved should immediately be conducted. For instances that the conflict involves a violation of the by-laws, the Condominium Property Act and the regulations of the corporation, a written complaint must be filed at the office of the Board of Directors. Sanctions handed down by the Board of Directors or the Condominium Corporation must be within their power or authority. If in case a higher authority or regulatory body is needed to resolve the conflict, a mediation or arbitration court can also be an option for resolution.</p>\r\n'),
(20, 'Who takes care of the building and the common areas of the condominium complex?', '<p>Daily maintenance and operation for the common areas are managed by the Board of Directors on behalf of the Condominium corporation. Some choose to have a permanent manager or service provider to do the chores for them. Payment of these service providers will come from the condominium fees that each unit owner has contributed. Regular maintenance obligations by the condominium corporation includes common plumbing, electrical, heating and air-conditioning systems, roof and wall repairs, windows and door repair, lawn, garden, recreational grounds and parking areas. Any repair works inside your unit, regardless of plumbing, electrical and the like, shall be carried out by the unit owner.</p>\r\n'),
(21, 'What taxes do I need to pay?', '<p>Please take note that the condominium corporation does not pay for property taxes and the unit owners will have the sole responsibility of paying their own property tax coupled with an equal percentage sharing for the incurred expenses in common areas. If you are still planning to purchase a condominium unit, you can determine the property as shown in the purchase documents but it is better to check it with the municipal government to confirm and if there are changes or increase in taxes. For example, some municipalities have lower property tax for condominiums as they exclude some services like garbage collection and snow clearing. Instead, the saved amount can help you contribute to your condominium fees, which usually covers those types of services.</p>\r\n'),
(22, 'Can anyone enter my unit?', '<p>No one can enter your unit not unless he or she has secured proper notice and approval from you. With regards to the advance notice, you must be given a 48-hour notice in advance before someone can enter your unit.

Depending on the by-laws, the hours of entry will be usually between 8am to 8pm from Monday to Friday only. Not unless in the event of an emergency where someone needs to go inside your unit. Aside from accidents and fire, an emergency situation can include provision of water, power and any other utility service that affects other unit owners.</p>\r\n'),
(23, 'Can I rent my condominium?', '<p>Yes, you can rent your condominium unit. But we highly advise that you read the declaration and the by-laws to be sure if renting out a unit is allowed within your condominium complex, as some condominium corporations do not allow. When you rent a unit, you will typically inform the condominium corporation through a formal writing which will contain your projected length of stay and the rental amount. You have to note that even if condominium corporations allow unit rental, they only allow long-term lease agreement. In this case, you will automatically become a landlord and will need to abide with the Residential Tenancies Act on top of the Condominium Property Act.</p>\r\n'),
(24, 'What by-laws and other rules should I need to be familiar with?', '<p>First, you have to remember that every condominium complex has its own by-laws so it very important to know your own by-laws. Many condominium by-laws have strict rules on the alteration of the unit space together with its architectural appearance. Examples of this are restrictions on the change of exterior fixtures, installation of a satellite dish, adding new gazebo, installation of window type air-conditioning and other changes that may affect the condominium&rsquo;s overall structure and safety. But still you can do so with the changes as long as the condominiums Board of Directors will approve the changes and as long the by-laws grants the Board of Directors the power to approve such request. Other rules may also include the restrictions to the number of occupants per unit, raising of pets, noise and parking limitations.</p>\r\n'),
(25, 'What are the condominium owner’s rights and responsibilities?', '<p>Your rights will include to vote on matters that will affect unit owners, use common areas, access to information from the condominium corporation and you may use the services of a mediation or arbitration court if there are any disputes within the condominium corporation, the board of directors or just between unit owners that needs to be resolved.

(30, 'What is Phased Development?', '<p>Condominium projects are sometimes developed in phases. If you are purchasing a unit that is in a phased development, you should review the conditions of the Development Disclosure Statement and understand how the key points in the disclosure would affect you.

(33, 'Who pays for the Funds Reserve Study?', '<p>As an effect to the implementation of the Condominium Property Act, the Declarant for a new condominium project is responsible for hiring a professional who will prepare the completion of the study. This has become a pre-requisite before a new project can be approved.

(35, 'How much money should be in the reserve fund?', '<p>There is a trend for condominium corporations to follow wherein the reserve fund will depend on the size of the condominium complex. For a small complex that consists of 10 units and below, the reserve fund must be equal to the annual budget. Meaning for a 30- year projection, a fund equivalent to a year&rsquo;s operational budget must be intended for major repair works. For larger complex having 10 or more units, the reserve fund must not be lower than the minimum amount recommended in the reserve fund study. In case the reserve fund is not sufficient enough to shoulder the repair works due to unforeseen factors, yet deemed necessary, the unit owners can be asked to equally contribute to pay for the remaining balance needed in the repair.</p>\r\n'),
(36, 'Why are Reserve Fund Studies important?', '<p>Reserve fund studies are very important since they help the condominium corporations in determining their upcoming major expenses that will incur a relative high percentage amount of budget from the reserve fund. The study will also detail out all the mandatory repairs as a result of the wear and tear over time. In cases where the reserve fund cannot shoulder major repairs, especially in simultaneous repairs in different parts of the complex at the same time, the condominium corporation can prioritize the repair works according to necessity. For example, the replacement of the roofing system is more important than the repainting of the building.</p>\r\n'),
(37, 'What is a Reserve Fund Study?', '<p>A reserve fund study is both an analysis and a forecast of at least 30 years of all projected major repairs within the condominium complex. The study should indicate the details of the projection on what particular part within the condominium complex will need repairs or replacement within a period of 30 years. It should also contain the estimated budget, which will also become the basis for the amount needed from the collective contributions in the condominium fee.

(38, 'What is a Contingency Fund?', '<p>A contingency fund is set up by the condominium corporation, that is purposely allocated to cover unexpected expenses like emergency repairs that is not included in the annual operational budget. In can also cover budget shortages at the end of a year and any expenses specified in the by-laws. In cases of an unforeseen event aside from emergency repairs, a contingency fund can also be used. For example, a contingency fund can cover the cost of sudden increase in raw materials and utilities like water and electricity. In cases where the contingency fund will be exhausted and the budget needed for a major repair is still short, the condominium corporation can either increase the condominium fees or charge additional fees for a certain amount of time through a special agreement amongst unit owners.</p>\r\n');

This does not mean they will definitely get the lend because their credit reports, wages and bank proclamations still need to be verified before they can receive a commitment from the lender for the mortgage.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all mortgage providers prequalify people at no charge. Many of them will even do it on the internet. In ordering to be pre-approved, an application going to take.

The words short sales and foreclosures have become synonymous with great deals.

It involves two parties, the buyers and sellers. The sellers may or may not have a mortgage on their property but the important thing to understand is that the amount of the note or mortgage does not exceed the sale price of the property. In this case the sellers at their sole discretion can sell the property at a price that is convenient for them and do not need third-party or lender approval to do so, because the proceeds from the sale more than cover all expenses including the repayment of the note.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="resale_homes_box_three">\r\n<div class="container">\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="resale_homes_img_right"><img alt="" class="img-responsive" src="http://realestate.homula.com/wp-content/themes/realsite/images/resale-homes-images-2.png" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div class="resale_homes_content">\r\n<h3 class="resale_homes_h3_right">Short Sale</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM), where after five years the rate adjusted to prime plus 5 percent. Fast forward five years, Mr. Smith loses his job, and to make matters worse his mortgage payments tripled overnight because of the adjustment in rate. Now the family definitely can&rsquo;t afford the new mortgage payments and are forced to sell their home. Unfortunately, because of market conditions and declining property values, it would be impossible for them to sell their house for the amount of the mortgage. Therefore, they are selling the property for a shortfall which constitutes a short sale. Very simplistically, a short sale means when there is a sale and the person owes more on the property than the property is worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="resale_homes_box_four">\r\n<div class="container">\r\n<div class="row">\r\n<div class="resale_homes_img_left"><img alt="" class="img-responsive" src="http://realestate.homula.com/wp-content/themes/realsite/images/resale-homes-images-3.png" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div class="resale_homes_content">\r\n<h3 class="resale_homes_h3_left">Foreclosure or bank-owned property</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Toronto real estate brokers a foreclosure is a property where the note bearer has forcefully evicted the inhabitants for nonpayment of their mortgages. Basically if we take the previous example with the smith family and assume they stopped paying their mortgage, eventually they would be driven out of their home and bank would take over the property. Since lenders are not in the business of owing property, they proceed to sell the property in as is condition on the open market. Bank properties are often the fastest deals to close, but have their own challenges because they are often properties that have not been lived in for a while. These properties need attention to bring them up to the living standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Homula has helped many people across Canada to achieve their goals in the real estate market. We would like to stress the importance of working with reputable real estate professionals. The professionals that you surround yourself with in making this important choice can make a world of difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our philosophy is that decisions are always better made when you are well informed of the process; it never hurts to be too well informed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Purchasing a brand new, newly constructed home is an appealing prospect for some, but if you&rsquo;re not dead-set on a fresh home, resale homes are a great choice that can still offer you the opportunity to live in your dream home. However, should know exactly what you&rsquo;re getting yourself into when purchasing one, and our Toronto real estate experts are here to educate you on everything you need to know about them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Replacement Costs:</strong> While in newly constructed homes everything is new, resale homes have been in use for a while, meaning components such as the furnace, water heater and air conditioning unit could be past their prime. Always do you research on these components and get a feel for when each unit is going to need replacing and how much it will cost. This will save you the hassle of purchasing a home that you love, only to realize that you need to invest thousands of dollars into replacement costs. Typical improvements include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Heating and air conditioning<br />\r\n&bull; Flooring and carpeting<br />\r\n&bull; Exterior and interior painting<br />\r\n&bull; Remodeling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Consumption: One of the biggest appeals of newly constructed homes is their energy efficiency. Many of them come with energy certifications that cover walls, roofs windows, doors and appliance packages and have to meet tougher energy efficiency standards than older homes. If you value the importance of investing in something &ldquo;green,&rdquo; resale homes might not be the best option for you as many of them were built years ago when energy standards were much lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resale Value: Are you planning on selling your home in the future? Newly constructed homes are typically more desirable and thus have a higher resale value than older homes, making them a better choice for those that plan to sell their home at some point. However, this is not always the case &ndash; with some hard work and the proper renovations, you can significantly bolster your homes resale value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Negotiation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the big advantages of purchasing a resale home is the flexibility that you will have during the negotiation process. Everything from closing dates to prices can be negotiated and with the help of an experienced realtor, you can really knock down the price of your investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deposit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to new construction homes, the deposits for resale homes are much more affordable at the time of agreement.

There is no specific size, design or style that defines what a luxury home is. A luxury home could be a 30,000 square foot mansion, or a 2,500 square foot home that features intricate crown moulding throughout the interior. Searching for a luxury <strong>MLS listing</strong> is not an easy task for the average person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases, only a <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/agents/"><strong>qualified real estate agent</strong></a>&nbsp;has access to an exclusive listing. Many sellers avoid putting pictures and information about their properties on the internet in order to protect their privacy. If the listing does happen to appear on MLS, the word &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; will appear instead of the cost of the house. In this case, your real estate agent will have to contact the listing agent in order to inquire about the price of the home and work out a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you decide to purchase a luxury home, you should take heed to the following tips:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="row exclusive_homes_wr">\r\n<div class="col-sm-6">\r\n<div class="exclusive_homes_box">\r\n<h4>Due Diligence</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the fact that all real estate investments could either make or break your pocket, it is imperative for you to hire an expert <strong><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/home-inspector/">home inspector</a></strong>&nbsp;prior to purchase. Luxury home are often large, and will require the eyes and knowledge of an expert. Apart from the items and features included in many homes, an expert may also need to inspect:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lawn irrigation systems</li>\r\n	<li>Indoor movie theatre</li>\r\n	<li>Landscape lighting</li>\r\n	<li>Spas and Pools</li>\r\n	<li>Exterior fireplaces</li>\r\n	<li>Heated driveways/floors</li>\r\n	<li>Surveillance and security systems</li>\r\n	<li>Awning systems</li>\r\n	<li>Automatic screens</li>\r\n	<li>Central vacuum systems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-6">\r\n<div class="exclusive_homes_box">\r\n<h4>Photos Aren&rsquo;t Everything</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Many large homes aren&rsquo;t as photogenic as you might think, so don&rsquo;t dismiss them purely based on their front elevation photos. Once you narrow down the choices that are most appealing to you, take a trip to see them in person &ndash; sometimes you really have the get up close and personal to really appreciate what they have to offer.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-6">\r\n<div class="exclusive_homes_box">\r\n<h4>Evaluation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you manage to get a close look at some luxury homes, evaluate your options closely. Take note of everything from construction methods and architectural highlights to security systems. Evaluating a luxury home is a much more detailed process than a standard home, so be prepared to get highly involved if you want to uncover every little detail of the potential properties and make the right purchasing decision.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-6">\r\n<div class="exclusive_homes_box">\r\n<h4>Financing</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to smaller mortgages, the loan process for buying a luxury home takes quite a while. Even if you have stellar credit and a very high income, it could take up to 60 days to secure a loan. To speed up the process, it is recommended that you contact a reputable <strong><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/mortgage-broker/">mortgage broker</a></strong>&nbsp;so that they can get you pre-approved earlier on in the process.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-6">\r\n<div class="exclusive_homes_box">\r\n<h4>Title Insurance</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Always invest in title insurance to ensure your protection against any problems that are forgotten. In addition, make sure to take a look at the exceptions page of the title insurance process prior to closing and run it buy your agent to make sure that everything covered in it is crystal clear.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-6">\r\n<div class="exclusive_homes_box">\r\n<h4>Contact an Expert Real Estate Agent</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The importance of contacting an expert real estate agent cannot be stressed enough. They know exactly how to find you all of the information you need. In addition to this, and as mentioned before, they have access to information that is not posted on the internet. Real estate agents are timely, professional and extremely knowledgeable.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-6">\r\n<div class="exclusive_homes_box">\r\n<h4>TIP: Use a Local Agent!</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to luxury homes, using a local real estate agent is very beneficial. These agents will be very familiar with the area that you want to buy in and since there&rsquo;s a higher degree of control over access to high-end properties, you&rsquo;re going to want one who can easily connect you with the open houses and appointments needed to see them in person.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-6">\r\n<div class="exclusive_homes_box">\r\n<h4>The Search Process</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main reasons that an agent is so essential for luxury homes lies in the fact that many of them are unlisted in order to protect the seller&rsquo;s privacy. Many of these exclusive properties can only be found through the personal networks of realtors, making MLS of no help to you. Using the connections of an experienced agent can greatly benefit you during the search process and expand your options beyond what is on standard search engines and listings.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-6">\r\n<div class="exclusive_homes_box">\r\n<h4>Patience Is a Virtue</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day, patience is one of the most beneficial traits to have during the process of purchasing a luxury home. These homes are a big financial obligation and you don&rsquo;t want to make a hasty decision that you&rsquo;ll later regret. Take your time when considering your options and gather as much information as you can about each potential home. Consult with your agent regularly and don&rsquo;t be afraid of passing up good homes, because chances are you&rsquo;re going to need to give up on a few &ndash; it&rsquo;s all part of the process.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="col-sm-6">\r\n<div class="exclusive_homes_box">\r\n<h4>Luxury</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Luxury real estate market has experienced a record amount of growth over the last few years and continuously grows on a daily basis.

This includes:</span>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class="list_icon"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Flyers</li>\r\n	<li class="list_icon"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Ads in the local newspaper</li>\r\n	<li class="list_icon"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>All forms of social media</li>\r\n	<li class="list_icon"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Postings online</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">When you host an open house, inform your neighbours. Invite them and ask them to bring anyone they know who is looking to purchase a home. This allows prospective buyers to have a chat with the locals in person when they are viewing the home. They will get a clear idea of the type of locality and community the home has to offer. The surrounding neighbourhood is a big factor buyers consider before they make a purchase.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="tab-pane fade" id="organization">\r\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">The marketing campaign for an open house should always start a week in advance. This gives potential buyers time to reshuffle their schedule, in order to make the event. The scheduled date of the open house should never conflict with major sporting or local civic events. This increases the chances of having more attendees. When you host the event, ask a friend or family member to help. Always have someone at the front door to greet new arrivals. This generates a friendly, casual atmosphere while leaving you and your agent free to show the house to the visitors who are already present. Hand out flyers to everyone who visits, the fliers should have clear pictures and contact information for yourself and your agent. If possible, have a professional photographers take the pictures of the house.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="tab-pane fade" id="clean_up">\r\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that the house is not just neat and tidy but absolutely spotless, especially the kitchen and bathrooms because these are the rooms that could potentially make or break a sale. For the viewings, try to use as much natural light as possible, open the drapes in every single room. If you have pets, leave them with a friend at least a few days in advance. Remove any litter boxes and vacuum up any loose strands of fur that may be lying around. Another important thing to remember is to always put away items of value. If you have valuable decorations, do not leave them in plain view. <b><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/about-us/">Our professionals</a> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;agree that theft is a surprisingly common occurrence at an open house. The last thing to remember is to refrain from giving out personal information to prospective buyers. Try not to let details about why you are selling the home slip out during casual conversation. Little tit bits of information can be used as a bargaining chip during final negotiations. </span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="tab-pane fade" id="last_minute_fixes">\r\n<p>When it&rsquo;s getting down to the wire, make sure that everything is set to really &ldquo;wow&rdquo; your prospective buyers. Pick up after any pets that you have, open up your curtains to let some light in and keep some windows open to freshen up the environment. In addition, make sure that all of your driveways and walk areas are clear and safe for all of your visitors.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="stbg_1">\r\n<div class="container">&nbsp;\r\n<h3><span class="tittle_style">Why organize an open house?</span></h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>It might seem like a lot of unnecessary work, but organizing an open house offers numerous benefits that can draw in buyers and help you find the right one for your home. Some of these benefits include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="nav nav-tabs">\r\n	<li class="active"><a data-toggle="tab" href="#more_buyers">More Buyers</a></li>\r\n	<li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#setting_scene">Setting the Scene</a></li>\r\n	<li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#interested_buyer">Interested Buyers</a></li>\r\n	<li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#comparison">Comparison</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class="tab-content">\r\n<div class="tab-pane fade in active" id="more_buyers">\r\n<p>Open houses are a great way to draw in potential buyers that would otherwise have been too unmotivated to book a showing. In addition, they draw in visitors in a more diverse amount of ways than a standard listing. Ask your family and friends to spread the word to people they think would be interested in purchasing your home and make sure to invest in some advertising and <strong><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/sign-suppliers/">signage</a></strong> to rope in as many potential buyers as possible, both casual and serious.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="tab-pane fade" id="setting_scene">\r\n<p>Traditional showings can be stressful and require lots of upkeep when it comes to keeping your home clean and ready for any potential showings. Open houses give you plenty of time to prepare your home and make it &ldquo;show ready&rdquo; in advance as you&rsquo;ll know exactly when your prospective buyers are going to be in your home. They&rsquo;re a great way to minimize the amount of cleaning you need to do while at the same time maximizing the amount of prospective buyers that get to see your home.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="tab-pane fade" id="interested_buyer">\r\n<p>For buyers who are already interested in your home, open houses are a better way for them to come and get a look at it in a less formal manner when compared to private showings. It&rsquo;s a great way for them to look around without feeling rushed and even bring some friends and family along to get a second opinion. With a bit of luck, you could lock in a potential buyer that otherwise might have not asked for another showing.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="tab-pane fade" id="comparison">\r\n<p>Certain locations will have no shortage of open houses on weekends, making them a great way for you to show off your home and really set it apart from the competition. Many buyers will likely be stopping by more than one open house and comparing the benefits of each, so focus on making your home stand out and highlight the ways that it&rsquo;s different from the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people just turn to the internet when they are looking to buy or sell something. Although the open house has become the tradition of a bygone era, if it is marketed correctly and professionally advertised, it can be a very effective marketing tool. A good open house can draw in prospective buyers that you otherwise would have missed out on and give you the opportunity to set yourself apart from the local competition.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n', '', '', 1, 0),

Although you might think that listing your home is the first step in the process of selling it, there&rsquo;s actually a lot to do before you make the leap. At Homula, we are experts at connecting you with reputable Toronto real estate agents who will walk you through the entire listing process. Take a look at the things you should consider before listing your home.</p>\n            <h3>Get Estimates for Your Planned Renovations and Upgrades</h3>\n            <p>When you&rsquo;re getting ready to list your home, chances are you&rsquo;re going to be replacing a lot of things that have outlived their welcome &ndash; this could be anything from a new furnace, roof or water heater. However, many people aren&rsquo;t prepared for the financial commitment that comes with this process, so make sure to get some accurate estimates on the costs of your renovations, replacements and upgrades to give you a better idea of how much money you&rsquo;re going to need to shell out.</p>\n            <div class="list_my_house_box_1">\n                <div><strong class="active_strong">Clean</strong><strong>Invest in Curb Appeal</strong><strong>Prepare for Privacy Invasion</strong><strong>Get Your Papers Together</strong></div>\n                <p class="box_1_p_1">No matter how much you hate the idea, you&rsquo;re going to have to accept the fact that listing your home means you&rsquo;re going to have to clean it. And be sure not to skimp &ndash; a light clean isn&rsquo;t going to cut it. Now is the time to invest in some heavy-duty cleanup and get the dirt and grime out of those hard-to-reach areas that you typically pass up on maintaining, such as behind your stove or fridge.</p>\n                <p class="box_1_p_2">Curb appeal refers to how your home looks from the outside and is a crucial part in getting prospective buyers to consider your property. Anything from maintaining your lawn to straightening your mailbox can increase your home&rsquo;s curb appeal. Failing to keep track of such small details might not seem like a big deal, but it can be the difference between people driving by your home and inquiring about purchasing it and disregarding it because of something on the exterior that turned them off.</p>\n                <p class="box_1_p_3">Unless you choose to exclusively do private showings &ndash; something you&rsquo;re <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/find-a-realtor/" target="_blank">realtor</a> will advocate against &ndash; you&rsquo;re going to need to get used to having people in your home on a regular basis. This means strangers in your home opening your closets and cupboards and seeing how you live.

There are firms which provide free home reports and there are instances where you need to pay to have one done. At Homula, we provide you with a home report that is free of cost. Anyone buying or selling a <strong><a class="content-interlink" href="http://realestate.homula.com/" target="_blank">home</a></strong> should have a clear idea as to what such a report pertains to. Almost MLS listing <span style="font-weight: 400;">has received a home report.</span> </p>\n				<p>Many real estate firms have suffered a lawsuit as they were not providing proper home reports. Sales of homes were not being finalized because the reports were missing critical information about the property.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="col-sm-6">\n			<div class="current_box">\n				<h3>What is Included in a Home Report?</h3>\n				<p>A home report must include a single survey by a certified survey provider on the condition and value of a house. This comes with an in-depth energy report. The energy report includes an energy efficiency rating and an energy performance certificate. This entails a clear outline of gas and electricity bills and potential areas of the home where updates or alterations have to be made to increase energy efficiency. Lastly, the report contains a property questionnaire which includes a list of all the changes made to the property and factoring costs.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="col-sm-6">\n			<div class="current_box">\n				<h3>How Long is a Home Report?</h3>\n				<p>There is no specific time period that such a report is valid for, but if the property has been on the market for an extended period of time, the buyer has the right to ask for a new report to be constructed. If a prospective buyer does ask for a report, you or your agent must provide them a copy of the report within 10 days.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="col-sm-6">\n			<div class="current_box">\n				<h3>Can You Refuse a Proposal for a Home Report?</h3>\n				<p>You can refuse the proposal, but you must provide adequate information as to why you are making the refusal. You can refuse it based on the grounds that you believe the buyer does not have the financial means to purchase the home or if you feel the buyer is not a serious player and you have other options available to you. Under no circumstance is a seller allowed to refuse a home report based on discriminatory factors. There are instances however, that if you are marketing your own home, you can generate your own home report. In such an instance, the report has a validity period and the buyer can chose to refuse your estimates. The buyer is allowed to make the demand that the report be prepared by a certified professional.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="col-sm-6">\n			<div class="current_box">\n				<h3>Is a Home Report Always Required?</h3>\n				<p>There are also instances where a report is not required.

For example, a new house cannot have out of date ventilation piping or heating and cooling equipment that does not meet energy standards. A home report is one of the most trustworthy pieces of documentation during a real estate transaction.

These plans are best for periods when energy prices are low, but run the risk of higher prices when price spikes occur.

expert </span>Toronto real estate <span style="font-weight: 400;">agents at Homula provide home inspections for the purpose of providing you with vital information about your property. Receiving a home inspection will be of great benefit to you. You should have your home inspected before it is labeled as an </span>MLS Listing.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are a few things to remember before going forward with an evaluation and we have listed them below. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p><b>Upgrades</b>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make updates to your home before the evaluation. First and foremost, do a little something that will differentiate your home from all the other houses on the street. Put in a flower bed on your front lawn, or something simple yet elegant that catches the eye. First impressions are everything, and a little feature that sets you apart is essential. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, repair leaky faucets or broken windows. Keep in mind that evaluators appraise homes in 500 dollar increments. Something as inconspicuous as a missing hand rail can have a huge impact on the final financial value of your house. A <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/property-management/">property manager</a> can assist you with this.</span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third thing to remember is, be careful what you spend your money on. There is a common misconception that nicer kitchens and bathrooms really increase the value of your home. That is not entirely true. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	    <h3>Research</h3>\r\n	    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/agents/"><strong>Our agents</strong></a> will do some research in order to see what home buyers in your area are looking for. A working couple with a stringent schedule may not be looking into a fancy, fully stocked, restaurant level kitchen. Bathroom and kitchen remodels are expensive; if it looks fine keep it that way. Keep some money aside for a paint job or new doors. These are little changes that can create a major impact on the final evaluation for your home. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	    <h3>Actual Age Vs. Effective Age</h3>\r\n	    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing is the difference between actual age and effective age. If you have a century old home, look at changes you can make to improve effective age. Do not waste time and money on upgrades that do not improve the effective age of your home. You may need to hire a builder to give you tips on what to do, but it is something that is required. If you have a century old home with an effective age between 3 to 5 years, you have a very appealing piece of property. After you make all the updates that are needed, give a list of all the changes to the evaluator. The appraiser can use the list when your home is put up for sale. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	    <h3>Personal Touch</h3>\r\n	    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before having an evaluation, provide details about everything you like about your house. Mention little details about your house that really appeals to you. This might be something the evaluator can relate to and the same can be said about a potential buyer. Also, talk about the neighbourhood in general – all the features about your neighbours and locality you like. If there is a nice place five minutes away that serves spectacular chicken wings, mention it. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <h3>Clean Up</h3>\r\n	    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be thinking to yourself, dirty dishes in the sink or a half finished motorbike in the garage will not affect the property value. A home evaluation paints a complete picture. The property may be in perfect condition, but when an appraiser sees a messy area, it could affect your property’s value. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>', '', '', 5, 0);

to ensure that you, your family, and all of your belongs are transported carefully and professionally from your former home to your new one. After you’ve successfully made it through the Toronto real estate process, you want to be sure that this final piece of the moving process is completed safely and hassle-free. While the do-it-yourself option may have been an attractive solution in the past, there’s no reason not to hire a moving company to help you with this next move. Here are just a few reasons why a professional moving company is the best way to complete your transition into your new dream home.</p>\r\n	    <p><strong>Spend Time On More Important Matters</strong>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p>Moving day can be one of the most stressful days in the year, especially if you’re trying to do it all yourself. Aside from actually transporting your belongings, you will need to have your telephone, cable, and utilities hooked up, change your identification, and unpack your belongings. When you’re not worried about lifting and transporting, you can spend moving day working on these equally as important tasks. This means that you won’t have to wait days for services to be hooked up, nor will you be living amongst boxes for weeks on end while you try and find the time to unpack. Simply have your movers take care of transportation, and you can spend that time doing more important matters.</p>\r\n	    <p><strong>Movers Are Incredibly Efficient</strong>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p>Professional movers are just that, professionals. They have the tools, experience, and know-how to get an entire house moved in much less time than it would take an amateur to do it on their own. They can disassemble and reassemble your furniture, and will know just the right way to pack everything in the truck so your box of valuables doesn’t fall and break along the way.</p>\r\n	    <p><strong>Insurance and Liability Concerns<br>\r\n	</strong>\r\n	        <br> The only thing worse than asking your friends and family to help you move is seeing one of them become injured in the process. Professional movers are covered under workplace liability plans, meaning that even if an injury were to happen, you won’t find yourself liable for any damages. Most professional movers also have liability insurance, so even if something gets lost or damaged in the process, you can be sure that the costs of replacement will be covered.</p>\r\n	    <p><strong>Seasonal Moves</strong>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p>Moving in extreme temperatures always carries with it increased risk for injury, not to mention contempt by your friends and family for being forced to help during frigid weather or blasting heat. Professional movers will be accustomed to these conditions, and will know how to approach the situation with the right gear and wearing the right clothing to get the job done.</p>\r\n	    <p><strong>You Might Actually Save Money</strong>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p>While the upfront cost of hiring movers is obviously higher than asking friends and family to help for free, you might actually save yourself time in the long run. Renting a truck big enough to hold all your belongings can come at a huge cost, as can the price of gas, mileage, and insurance. There’s also the risk of multiple trips, which will drive up those costs even further. A professional moving company will be able to survey your home, and from there determine the best way to get everything moved in one trip. They are less likely to break something, and won’t demand food and refreshments when the job is done.</p>\r\n	    <p><strong>Contact Us</strong>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p>Contact your real estate professionals at Homula to find the perfect moving company to handle your next move.</p>\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>', '', '', 5, 0),

(26, 'leasing agent', 'leasing-agent', '', '<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Homula, we connect you with top notch leasing agents. The process of leasing comes along with many procedures and real estate laws. Any Toronto real estate professional would agree that it is imperative for you to have an understanding of what leasing really is.</span>\r\n\r\n<h3>Everything you need to know about Commercial and Residential leasing</h3>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A commercial lease is very different from a residential lease. It is an agreement between a tenant and landlord for the use of a particular property for business practices. It is a point of operation for a business entity. Signing a lease is a two part process. First, you sign an offer lease, and if you reach an agreement, you sign a lease which contains the finalized offer, highlighting the details of the negotiations.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you are looking to lease, always look to negotiate. You do not have to agree to the landlord’s stipulations immediately. With leasing, there is always a little wiggle room. Our professionals will be ready before you finalize any paperwork. Our<a href="http://realestate.homula.com/real-estate-lawyer/"><strong> real estate lawyers</strong></a> can take a look at the lease and have a realtor look at the property. Make sure you are not being taken for a spin. Similarly, any changes to negotiations have to written. Verbal negotiations do not hold up in court without paperwork backing it up. If anything seems fishy, be ready to walk away. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With commercial real estate there are different types of leases. The lease may be for a fixed term or it may be renewable after a certain time. The rent for commercial properties is always based on the space itself; it is priced according to square footage. This information may not be included in the </span>. <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 3 different types of leases:</span>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Percentage rent lease: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is mostly for retail places. You pay a base rent and then you pay a certain percentage of your sales. </span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Gross rental lease:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You pay a flat rate which equals to the base rent and you pay other expenses you have negotiated with your landlord. The Landlord covers some of the operating cost. </span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Net lease:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are three different kinds of net leases. Single net is when you pay some of the taxes plus base rent. Double net is when you pay insurance costs to the landlord in addition to some of the taxes and base rent. Triple net is when you cover any and all expenses associated with the property. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our home inspectors come in and measure the property, so that you can be certain that you are paying for the space which is being advertised. By hiring a real estate lawyer to read the lease, you can be clear as to exactly what you are paying for. An expert will be able to tell you exactly what the lease covers. Things such as, parking, utilities, cleaning services and security are extremely important to many people. A <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/home-inspector/"><strong>home inspection</strong></a> will allow you to see if there are any repairs that need to be made. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people want to have a commercial lease that enables them to make changes during the term. Your business may expand and you may outgrow your given space. Some people want options in their lease that allows them to sublet to a third party without their landlord’s permission. In addition, many people want a lease that lets you make changes to your property to increase productivity or for marketing purposes. Make all of your requirements very clear to your real estate lawyer.</span>', '', '', 5, 0),
(27, 'real estate lawyer', 'real-estate-lawyer', '', '<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a current or aspiring home owner, it’s imperative for you to understand the key terms that are used by </span>Toronto real estate <span style="font-weight: 400;">experts on a daily basis. Having a good understanding of the entire real estate industry will be of great benefit to you. Below, we’ll translate terms that are extremely important and relevant to real estate law. </span>\r\n<h3>What is Real Estate/Real Property Law?</h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal definition of real property or real estate is land and the buildings that are on it. Real estate can either be <a href="http://homula.idxbroker.com/idx/search/commercial-search">commercial</a> or residential. Every single </span>MLS listing <span style="font-weight: 400;">falls under the category “real estate.” </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate can either be owned by one or many people. It can be purchased by one person, and rented out or leased by another through rental agreements. Due to the fact that there are many different requirements and agreements involved in the entire processes of buying, selling, leasing, renting and investing, the need for a real estate lawyer is crucial. For the simple fact that land can be sold our bought at an extremely high price, there have been a plethora of laws put in place in order to ensure the real estate transactions are recorded correctly. Governments have set certain laws in order to determine which land is available for use and what can be done to that land. </span>\r\n<h3>Key Real Estate Terms</h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Escrow:</strong> Property of money that is securely held by a disinterested, third party. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Foreclosure:</strong> If the owner fails to pay back the mortgage, it is during this process that the lender will take back the house. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Title:</strong> A legal term that is used to describe who owns the land. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Closing:</strong> The meeting that occurs when ownership has been officially transferred. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mortgage:</strong> This is a loan that covers the entire cost of the house.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Insurance Law:</strong> Homeowner insurance protects your property from damages.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Landlord Tenant Law:</strong> This law covers the rules around renting real estate, which includes, leasing and eviction for commercial and residential tenants. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Estate Planning:</strong> When people would like to keep real estate within their family, estate planning attorneys assist them with the process of doing so. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tax Law:</strong> Having real estate that is mortgaged, or real estate in general, has a huge effect on the household’s taxes. Every homeowner is required to pay property taxes and should understand the tax code so that they don’t over or under pay. </span>\r\n<h3>Benefit of Having a Real Estate Lawyer</h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Without legal assistance, real estate transactions can be extremely difficult to understand. The investment in which you need to make in order to receive expert legal assistance is well worth it. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Expert real estate lawyers oversee the legalities that are involved in both selling and buying property in order to ensure their client is granted with fair and equal rights. These lawyers check the title of ownership to the property for any liabilities or issues, such as, liens.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, real estate lawyers protect buyers and sells from financial loss. </span><a class="content-interlink" href="http://realestate.homula.com/contact-us/"><b>Contact us</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today in order to connect with an expert real estate lawyer!</span>', '', '', 5, 0),

What will urge the house seekers to buy your home out of all that is available on the market? There are a number of small things that you can do to make a huge difference in the value or perceived value of your home. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire a Pro</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will want to take any advice your </span><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/agents/"><b>realtor </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">can provide you with to heart. This goes back to hiring one of expert home stagers to help you understand how you can improve the interior space of your home. They might be able to offer tips and tricks that are easy to do and that will increase the value of your home. Sometimes it can be as simple as moving furniture around, painting, removing items from the walls and more. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspect Your Home</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should </span><b><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/home-inspector/">hire an inspector</a></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;to look at your home before you put it up on the market. An inspector may be able to find hidden problems with your home that could be impacting its value. An inspector might be able to see things that you wouldn’t otherwise notice or consider. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paint </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the simplest and most cost effective improvement tips is to paint. A freshly painted room just looks nice and presentable. It can make your space seem more open and welcoming to buyers. Try to choose colours that are more neutral and not too out there. Simple is best when it comes to paint. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximize energy efficiency </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will want to get a professional to assess the energy efficiency of your home. You can then decide if there are small fixes you can do to help increase the energy efficiency of your home. People nowadays are very conscious about energy conservation. It can be a very important factor when they are considering purchasing a home. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landscaping</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way your home looks from the outside is very important. A buyer will be distracted by long grass or a poorly maintained property. You should do some low maintenance landscaping and make sure the gardens look nice. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleanliness counts </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure your home is tidy and well organized. This goes a long way when people consider your home. They want to feel immediately comfortable in the space and it can be distracting if there is too much clutter.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visually increase space </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of your home will affect the value of it. You can do some things to make the rooms in your house feel larger than they actually are. Maybe you are able to open up a wall to make a more open concept feel.

(29, 'graphic designer', 'graphic-designer', '', '<p><strong>Graphic Designer</strong> Your success as a real estate agent depends on many factors, from the way you navigate the MLS listing service to better serve your clients to the way you network for referrals. The single most important factor, however, is how you choose to present yourself through your printed material. This is why finding a graphic designer you can work with is essential. Your knowledge of the Toronto real estate market is what will help you become a hit with your clients, but the way they choose your services to begin with depends on the strength of your materials. <strong> How Can A Graphic Designer Help?</strong> A graphic designer can do a surprising number of things for you and your marketability. He or she can help you market yourself in a way you simply can&rsquo;t on your own. They can do so by creating materials that: &bull; Inform your clients about you &bull; Indicate what services you provide &bull; Develop your brand in a unique but professional way Developing your brand is a multifaceted task that shouldn&rsquo;t be taken lightly. Your graphic designer will help create postcards, brochures, your logo, business cards, banner ads, and other images. These are the tools you will use to advertise yourself as an expert in the real estate industry so they need to be professional and sleek. You want to attract the highest quality of customer, and a graphic designer can help make that happen. <strong> Where To Start</strong> The best place to start is to look at the promotional materials that your colleagues are distributing. From there you can get an idea of what words, what doesn&rsquo;t, and what type of materials you find to be best in line with the image you want to project. After you&rsquo;ve settled on a stylistic approach you prefer, make a list of all the materials you want your designer to take care of for you. Be sure to discuss your budget and your intentions with your graphic designer ahead of time, to ensure a smooth relationship. <strong>Figure Out Where Your Priorities Lie</strong> If you&rsquo;re unhappy with your website, or don&rsquo;t have one at all, it&rsquo;s a good idea to start here. Your prospective clients are turning to online browsing in growing numbers, and will want to see a sleek and professional website before they decide to hire you. Move on to advertising materials after that, and decide how you want to approach marketing yourself. Ask your designer about setting up social media accounts, and be sure to specify that you need images for those pages. <strong>How To Choose A Graphic Designer</strong> Homula has a comprehensive list of graphic designers, each one with experience and expertise in the real estate industry.

The </span>Toronto real estate <span style="font-weight: 400;">market prices are continuously increasing on a daily basis, as such, it is imperative for you to connect with a mortgage broker with the ability to get you a great deal. Whether your credit is bad, you have a low down payment, you are new to the country, or you have been recently divorced, our mortgage brokers can work to get you into the home of your dreams. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">By browsing through our exclusive </span>MLS listing <span style="font-weight: 400;">database, you will see a plethora of beautiful residential and commercial properties that our mortgage brokers will approve you for!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgage payments are probably the biggest and most important bill anyone pays in their lifetime. This causes many people to enlist the services of a mortgage broker to find them the best terms and rates. A good broker can get you a good deal 99% of the time!</span>\r\n\r\n<h3>Advantages of Hiring a Mortgage Broker </h3>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our experts can save you a lot of time and legwork. There are hundreds of lenders out there and finding the right one can be tiresome and stressful. Our brokers have contacts with a wide variety of lenders that are reliable and diligent. They also understand contracts and can steer you away from lenders who have hidden stipulations buried in their contracts. </span><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/agents/">Our experts </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">read between the lines and watch out for any hidden fees. At Homula, we have strong connections with a lot of lenders. Our brokers could even get you a special discount rate from a lender because he/she brings in so much business for that particular lending institution. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The alternative to hiring one of our brokers is spending hours ploughing through dozens of lenders, looking for the right one. Our experts will save you both time and money. There are a lot of fees associated with getting a new mortgage, like application fees and appraisal fees. Our professionals might get a lender to waive some of the fees or get you a contract where the fees are much more favourable. Little things like that make a broker extremely helpful.</span>\r\n\r\n<h3>Choosing a Broker </h3>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with Homula is an excellent idea. Outside of Homula, some brokers are commission salesmen. Their main objective is to get you into a mortgage that gives them the highest compensation. You are looking at a contract with a low interest rate and similarly low fees. You are in it for the long haul, but the broker is thinking about short term profit. As a result, depending on the broker, you might not see eye to eye and you might not get the best deal. Also, mortgage brokers cannot provide estimates. A broker''s estimates may not be accurate and the lender may choose to change the terms on the final agreement. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize the pros and the cons, the best thing you can do is </span><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/contact-us/"><b>contact </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a reputable mortgage broker today. </span>', '', '', 5, 0);

A home report is a crucial document that is needed in the </span><b>Toronto real estate </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">industry. </span>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <h2>What is a Real Estate Appraiser?</h2>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A real estate appraiser determines the current value of the property by evaluating the physical attributes of the house or building. The potential buyer or seller is then given a report. </span>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <h2>What is a Home Report?</h2>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A home report is a report card that highlights features essential to buyers and sellers of a house. There are firms which provide free home reports and there are instances where you need to pay to have one done. At Homula, we provide you with a home report that is free of cost. Anyone <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/"><strong>buying or selling</strong></a> a home should have a clear idea as to what such a report pertains to. Almost </span><b>MLS listing </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">has received a home report.</span>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many real estate firms have suffered a lawsuit as they were not providing proper home reports. Sales of homes were not being finalized because the reports were missing critical information about the property. </span>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <h2>What is Included in a Home Report?</h2>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A home report must include a single survey by a certified survey provider on the condition and value of a house. This comes with an in-depth energy report. The energy report includes an energy efficiency rating and an energy performance certificate. This entails a clear outline of gas and electricity bills and potential areas of the home where updates or alterations have to be made to increase energy efficiency. Lastly, the report contains a property questionnaire which includes a list of all the changes made to the property and factoring costs. </span>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <h2>How Long is a Home Report?</h2>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no specific time period that such a report is valid for, but if the property has been on the market for an extended period of time, the buyer has the right to ask for a new report to be constructed. If a prospective buyer does ask for a report, you or your agent must provide them a copy of the report within 10 days. </span>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <h2>Can You Refuse a Proposal for a Home Report?</h2>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can refuse the proposal, but you must provide adequate information as to why you are making the refusal. You can refuse it based on the grounds that you believe the buyer does not have the financial means to purchase the home or if you feel the buyer is not a serious player and you have other options available to you. Under no circumstance is a seller allowed to refuse a home report based on discriminatory factors. There are instances however, that if you are marketing your own home, you can generate your own home report. In such an instance, the report has a validity period and the buyer can chose to refuse your estimates. The buyer is allowed to make the demand that the report be prepared by a certified professional. </span>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <h2>Is a Home Report Always Required?</h2>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also instances where a report is not required. New housing or newly converted premises does not require a home report. This is because the property has to be built or remodelled according to building codes and regulations. For example, a new house cannot have out of date ventilation piping or heating and cooling equipment that does not meet energy standards. &nbsp;</span>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A home report is one of the most trustworthy pieces of documentation during a real estate transaction. There are severe penalties if it comes to light that any information on a report was falsified, during the marketing process. A transaction cannot be completed without a proper, methodical and calculative home report, and <a href="http://realestate.homula.com/agents/"><strong>our experts</strong></a> know can assist you with this today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', '', '', 5, 0),

There are buildings going up on every single corner, old buildings and housing complexes are being torn down to rebuild neighbourhoods. The outskirts of the city are also growing vastly. </span><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/resale-homes/"><b>Homes for sale in the GTA</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; are no longer the “out of the city, cheaper option”. That ended a very long time ago! Richmond Hill now is basically the city and the prices are through the roof.</span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto properties go very quickly, even if your home is not newly renovated and the best house on the block people will scoop it up to renovate themselves. The land itself and location of the home is more important to people, they are willing to put money into the house and make it exactly what they want instead of buying somewhere else. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good </span><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/agents/"><b>real estate agent </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;is so very important to have! You want someone who is knowledgeable of the city, is aware of the up and coming areas, the main/most coveted areas, the city’s history (which includes housing price history so that you can get a good idea if the home you have your eye on is worth its current listed price). Your agent should be able to gather information from you in detail to make sure they understand exactly what your wants and needs are, what your exact budget is and how flexible you are willing to be. If what you tell them is way out of line and impossible, they should tell you that right away and let you know what the real options would be for you and present you with other ideas. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t want someone who is just going to say yes to everything and then put you in a bad situations when they are not able to deliver, thinking that you will just fold and put up extra money or change your mind. Waste of time for everyone involved.</span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good realtor</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will make you will comfortable and secure, they should be trustworthy, professional but overall be genuine and in the business of making sure their clients are happy and get the best deal possible. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By </span><b><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/contact-us/">connecting with Homula today</a>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you are one step closer to receiving the home and insurance policy of your dreams. </span>\r\n	    </p>\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>', '', '', 5, 0),

the next step is to find a law firm who can represent you in this transaction. Many people have a negative opinion of lawyers, and may even caution you against hiring one for real estate transactions. While it isn’t a legal requirement to have a law firm represent a seller or a buyer, it can go along way to protecting you if anything happens to go wrong, and ensures that your rights are respected. Once you’ve navigated the MLS listing, found your home, or are ready to sell your old one, you should consult with a lawyer to assist you with the rest of the process.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Experience In The Field</strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Real estate lawyers have tons of experience in the industry. From taking highly specialized courses while still in law school, to acquiring on the job training, real estate lawyers are able to anticipate problems before they arise, and can help advise you against making uninformed decisions. Together with your real estae agent, they can review your Agreement of Purchase and Sale, and advise you on your rights and obligations under that agreement. They can also work with mortgage professionals to help you get funding for your new home, and will hold funds in escrow until the transaction is completed.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Certify Title And Assist With Boundary Issues</strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Certifying title isn’t overly important when it comes to purchasing a brand new home, but if you are working with another homeowner to purchase an older home, it’s essential that you ensure title is certified. Simply put, this means that there are no other individuals who could have a claim on your home, and that the current owners are in a position to sell. Lawyers are the only professionals who are authorized to complete this very essential service, which will help protect you against any unpleasant title surprises in the future. Lawyers can also advise you about any potential boundary issues, which comes in handy in cases where fences or shrubbery are installed in the wrong location. Even minor boundary disputes can turn into costly legal battles in the future, when you or your neighbour want to sell.\r\n        <br>\r\n        <strong><br>\r\nProtect Your Rights</strong>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Lawyers will ensure that your rights are protected throughout the entire process. This firm will ensure that you don’t enter into any agreements that will prove to be detrimental or costly to you in the future, and helps guard against being taken advantage of by a seller.

Whether you are a broker, investor, first time home buyer or a student, our Toronto real estate experts are readily available to answer any question(s) you may have about the real estate industry. At Homula, we pride ourselves in being available 24/7 for the purpose of ensuring you remain as knowledgeable as some of the biggest <b><a class="content-interlink" href="http://realestate.homula.com/agents/">real estate professionals</a></b> today! You may also ask us any questions about the MLS listing database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is some advice from us to you!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Choosing the right area for you</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class="ask_a_question_box">\r\n<p>If you are new to the city or are just looking to relocate having a great agent again is a major plus. Taking some time and exploring neighbourhoods and educating yourself about the prices are very necessary. You need to make a smart purchase, knowing you are making a good investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices will vary throughout the city, so you should be shopping according to your budget. Even if you are not in the core of downtown there are lots of great/young up and coming neighborhoods that might work out well for you. Midtown or Uptown, North York also has growing neighborhoods that are getting makeovers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a family and are looking for a home, there are so many options to choose from when looking for the perfect area for you. Think about if you will need schools nearby, transportation, shopping and etc. Budget again will be a major factor for you as well as what type of home you are looking for. <b>Homes for sale in Richmond Hill </b>are a great place to start looking, wonderful family communities, a lot to choose from and a great place to give you an idea of what might work or not work for you.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Option to Renovate</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class="ask_a_question_box">\r\n<p><a class="content-interlink" href="http://realestate.homula.com/resale-homes/"><b>Buying a property </b></a>&nbsp;that is not exactly perfect but saving some money could also be a great deal for you. It has to be a smart purchase of course; you have to know what is worth renovating and what isn&rsquo;t. Definitely get an inspector and have someone with a professional eye on renovations there to help you. Have a set budget in mind allocated for your renovations (and always add extra here as renovations do tend to go over sometimes), figure out a plan of how you will complete them and when. Before moving in? After you are already living there?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also think about how long you are planning on living in the house, if you are settling down and are not looking to move in the near future at all then you could definitely do anything with the house just the way you like it. Customize it just for you! But if you are purchasing an investment property and are looking to sell in the next few years, I would definitely recommend really thinking about your choices. You want to make the house d&eacute;cor appealing to the majority, think clean lines, classic, nothing too overwhelming. <a class="content-interlink" href="http://realestate.homula.com/home-stagers/"><b>Hire a designer</b></a>. This will for sure pay off for you, most people don&rsquo;t realize why their house is not selling or they are not getting the price they want when it&rsquo;s something simple like blue walls in one room, purple in the other, tacky d&eacute;cor in the bathroom etc. All important things! Most people are looking for ready to move into/turnkey homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b style="color: #337ab7;">Ask away!

The </span>Toronto real estate <span style="font-weight: 400;">market prices are continuously increasing on a daily basis, as such, it is imperative for you to connect with a mortgage broker with the ability to get you a great deal. Whether your credit is bad, you have a low down payment, you are new to the country, or you have been recently divorced, our mortgage brokers can work to get you into the home of your dreams. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By browsing through our exclusive </span>MLS listing <span style="font-weight: 400;">database, you will see a plethora of beautiful residential and commercial properties that our mortgage brokers will approve you for!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgage payments are probably the biggest and most important bill anyone pays in their lifetime. This causes many people to enlist the services of a mortgage broker to find them the best terms and rates. A good broker can get you a good deal 99% of the time!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Advantages of Hiring a Mortgage Broker</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our experts can save you a lot of time and legwork. There are hundreds of lenders out there and finding the right one can be tiresome and stressful. Our brokers have contacts with a wide variety of lenders that are reliable and diligent. They also understand contracts and can steer you away from lenders who have hidden stipulations buried in their contracts. </span><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/agents/">Our experts </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">read between the lines and watch out for any hidden fees. At Homula, we have strong connections with a lot of lenders. Our brokers could even get you a special discount rate from a lender because he/she brings in so much business for that particular lending institution. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alternative to hiring one of our brokers is spending hours ploughing through dozens of lenders, looking for the right one. Our experts will save you both time and money. There are a lot of fees associated with getting a new mortgage, like application fees and appraisal fees. Our professionals might get a lender to waive some of the fees or get you a contract where the fees are much more favourable. Little things like that make a broker extremely helpful.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Choosing a Broker</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with Homula is an excellent idea. Outside of Homula, some brokers are commission salesmen. Their main objective is to get you into a mortgage that gives them the highest compensation. You are looking at a contract with a low interest rate and similarly low fees. You are in it for the long haul, but the broker is thinking about short term profit. As a result, depending on the broker, you might not see eye to eye and you might not get the best deal. Also, mortgage brokers cannot provide estimates. A broker&rsquo;s estimates may not be accurate and the lender may choose to change the terms on the final agreement. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize the pros and the cons, the best thing you can do is </span><a href="http://realestate.homula.com/contact-us/"><b>contact </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a reputable mortgage broker today. </span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', '', '', 6, 0),
